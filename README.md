# Etch-a-Sketch
An Etch-a-Sketch app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript mimics the classic drawing toy. It features a grid where users can draw by hovering or clicking, adjustable grid sizes for precision, and options to clear or reset the canvas. Interactive and responsive, itâ€™s a fun way to practice DOM manipulation and CSS styling techniques!
